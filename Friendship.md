Friendship is a very special thing
I have a story about one of my extremely special ones
In kindergarten, I was very afraid of a girl called Emelie
She seemned to be very rude and often puled my hair
One day, my mom met Emelie's mom and they became fast friends
Our mothers arranged a playdate for us
I was dreading it and terribly scared
When I arrived at her house, I realised that Emilie had the same interest in books as me
Her mother tod my mother that Emelie was very jealous of her newborn baby brother at home, that is why she misbehaved
My mother told me to continue treating Emilie with kindness and make her feel cared for
Emilie and I soon became friends. Her behavoiur soon improved and she seemed kinder and happier
Till this day, Emilie and I are still close friends
Although we live in different countries now, we still keep in touch with each other and talk often. She is extremely trustworthy and thoughtful
I am delighted to have a friend like Emilie whom I can always rely on

However although there is friendship
There exists evil
In primary school, I was very good friends with a girl called Karen
She seemed to be very polite and often helped me
One day, my mom met Karen's mom and they became fast friends.
However, she came home and said:
"I don't like the sound of Karen
I feel like she wants to take advantage of your book reading habit"
